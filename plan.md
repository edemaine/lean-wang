# Wang Tiling Undecidability Formalization Plan

## Goal

Prove in Lean, using Mathlib's computability library, that both the encoded and
unencoded plane-tiling predicates for finite Wang tilesets are undecidable:

```lean
¬ ComputablePred (fun n : Nat => TilesPlane (decodeTileSet n))
¬ ComputablePred (fun T : TileSet => TilesPlane T)
```

The public conditional versions are already proved in `LeanWang.Final`. The
only remaining hypothesis is a concrete proof of `IsScaffold`.

## Chosen reduction

Use the Berger/Robinson fixed-corner construction from `cirm.pdf`, with the
intrinsically substitutive Ollinger/Robinson scaffold and Robinson's Section 7
free-line argument from `robinson.pdf`.

The reduction has three independent parts:

1. Undecidability of a seeded quarter-plane tiling problem by simulating one
   fixed universal machine.
2. Compactness, converting the infinite seeded quarter-plane tiling into
   finite fixed-corner squares of every size.
3. A scaffold that forces and realizes arbitrarily large fixed-corner payload
   squares inside a plane tiling.

## Completed machine side

The source-dependent machine compiler has been replaced by a fixed universal
argument.

1. `UniversalCode.universalCode` evaluates a supplied encoded
   `Nat.Partrec.Code` and input.
2. `UniversalTM0.code` translates this universal evaluator once through
   Mathlib's `ToPartrec`, TM2, TM1, and TM0 route.
3. `UniversalTM0.input c` writes `Nat.pair (encode c) 0` as the varying initial
   tape. Its construction is computable.
4. `TM0FoldedInput` proves that the parameterized initializer writes that word,
   rewinds to the origin, and enters the fixed TM0 simulation.
5. `UniversalFoldedReduction.program_haltsEmpty_iff` proves that the folded
   finite program halts exactly when `Nat.Partrec.Code.eval c 0` is defined.
6. `MachineTiles` and the scaffold reduction turn nonhalting into plane tiling.
7. Mathlib's `ComputablePred.halting_problem` yields both undecidability
   theorems.

There is no remaining source-uniform compiler, descriptor decoder, or generated
position-row obligation in the final theorem.

## Completed general tiling infrastructure

- Wang-tile and tileset encodings, finite rectangle search, and matching rules.
- Centered-box and square compactness for plane tilings.
- Fixed-corner square compactness for seeded quarter-plane tilings.
- Machine-history Wang tiles and the fixed-domino correctness theorem.
- The abstract `Scaffold` / `IsScaffold` reduction.
- A finite transcription of Figure 13 and Figure 16, including the corrected
  104 component triples in `figures/fig13-human.tsv`.
- Substitution-generated plane tilings for the corrected 104-symbol alphabet.
- The corrected Figure 16 `L2b` extension (`R1`, not `R3`) and a 104-tile Wang
  encoding that retains both thick-line boundary lanes.
- Finite certificates that every substituted block is valid and substitution
  preserves and reflects horizontal and vertical compatibility.
- Proposition 8's finite `4 x 4` test: all 328 extendable well-behaved central
  blocks are substitution images.
- A proposition-level local recognizability theorem: every valid typed `4 x 4`
  neighborhood with the distinguished central phase has a unique `Fin 104`
  parent whose four children are its central `2 x 2` block.
- Global desubstitution: every valid corrected-Ollinger plane is, up to one of
  four parity choices, the Figure 16 substitution of another valid plane.
- An infinite typed desubstitution tower, retaining the parity origin and four
  exact child equations between every pair of consecutive valid planes.
- A native-checked primitivity certificate: every corrected tile type occurs
  below every parent after five substitutions, so board patterns recur
  uniformly in every hierarchy.
- A tower-occurrence theorem turning that finite reachability into actual fine
  plane coordinates; in particular every corrected tile type occurs in every
  valid plane tiling.
- A lossless decoder from ordinary `TileIn tileSet` plane tilings to typed
  `Fin 104` planes, so the hierarchy applies directly to the public Wang-tiling
  predicate.
- A finite red-port topology and native certificate that every depth-two
  supertile contains a complete red rectangular cycle, providing a uniform
  seed for the nested Robinson boards.
- Finite local red-line expansion certificates and a proposition-level
  iteration theorem proving those red cycles double under every further
  substitution, hence occur at unbounded scales.
- A coordinate embedding theorem identifying each abstract grid refinement
  with the contiguous child block at the corresponding parity origin in an
  actual hierarchy tower.
- An iterated embedding theorem composing those parity origins through any
  tower depth and identifying the resulting fine-plane quadrant with the
  corresponding iterated refinement.
- A concrete-plane red-board theorem: every valid corrected-Ollinger plane has
  red rectangular cycles at explicit origins and unbounded `2^level` scales.
- The red-board seed is uniform for all 104 parents: its depth-two corners are
  `(1,1)` and `(3,3)`, yielding canonical scaled corners at `2^level` and
  `3 * 2^level` in every plane.
- A corrected 416-tile quarter subdivision with certified distinctness,
  decoding, and checkerboard phase transitions, replacing all old `Fin 92`
  Figure 18 site types.

## Remaining scaffold proof

The remaining theorem must construct a concrete `S : Scaffold` and prove
`IsScaffold S`. Keep this work independent of the machine reduction.

### 1. Obtain arbitrarily large free squares

Iterate desubstitution to recover the hierarchical square structure. Then use
Robinson's board/free-line argument to show that every plane scaffold tiling
contains arbitrarily large recognizable active squares with a distinguished
lower-left corner.

### 2. Prove backward realization

Construct scaffold tilings containing active-corner boxes of every finite size,
or equivalently finite layer patches that compactness assembles into the
required plane tiling. Show arbitrary payload tiles can be routed through the
active square and obstruction channels.

### 3. Package and finish

Bundle the forward and backward results as `IsScaffold S`, apply
`LeanWang.encoded_domino_problem_undecidable` and
`LeanWang.domino_problem_undecidable`, then run:

```bash
lake build
rg -n "sorry|admit|axiom" LeanWang
git diff --check
```

The final theorem should have no hypotheses and no source-dependent machine
infrastructure.
